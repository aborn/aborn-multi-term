# aborn-multi-term
File [multi-term.el](./multi-term.el) fork from [multi-term](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/multi-term.el). 
And I do some customize work in [multi-term-config.el](./multi-term-config.el).

## Why for this?
multi-term-config.el do some extensions for multi-term.


## Extensions
* fast switch when you open multi-terms.  
```elisp
multi-term-find
```
* Smart kill-line in multi-term mode.  
```elisp
multi-term-kill-line
```
* Auto recover previous term buffers.
